# Comparison of the overall performances of two dishwasgher detergents
A consumer products company has conducted a marketing experiment before launching a new dishwashing detergent. Two test detergents were randomly distributed to 549 households by mail. Each of them used their received products and returned a survey regarding the detergent's performance. The survey asked the following questions which can be called the response variables in the study:

1. Does the product provide value for money? (1:Poor, 3:Excellent)
2. How would you rate the product overall? (1:Poor, 3:Excellent)
3. How do you rate the product with respect to its performance (cleaning dishes)? (1:Poor, 3:Excellent)
4. Do you like the scent (perfume) of the product? (1:Poor, 3:Excellent)
5. Does use of the product irritate your hand? (1:A lot, 3:Not at all)
6. Did you like the color of the product? (1: Not at all, 2: Very much)
7. Are you satisfied with the packaging? (1:Not at all, 3: Extremely satisfied)
8. How much effort did you spend in dispensing the detergent? (1:A lot of effort, 3: It was very easy)
9. Did you think the package was filled as per your expectation: (1:Poor, 3:Excellent)

Each household answered the questions on a scale of 1-3, with 1 being worst and 3 being the best.
Note that the first two questions represent the usersâ€™ overall evaluation of the product, whereas the other questions represent their views on specific aspects of the product. The response on the overall rating ofthe product(question no.2) is the one of primary interest to the management.
